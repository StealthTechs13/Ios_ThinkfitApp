# Ios_ThinkfitApp
 With ThinkFit, boost your productivity, efficiency, focus, fitness and overall wellbeing to achieve your goals in life.   Not “just another productivity and self-help app”....   We do offer:   - “Advanced” Tasks Management: A simple task list but with a twist. We do actually coach you to properly prioritize your projects.  - An “Intelligent” Time-Boxing (Pomodoro) Timer? We have it covered: it’s called FOCUS TIME.  Stay focused and get more things done. Do not feel frustrated for not being able to complete the timer. All the parameters in ThinkFit are using a Feedback Loop to be User-adaptive.  Time will automatically adapt to your current needs and capabilities. In fact, we do believe technology has to adapt to the User, not vice-versa.  - Let’s be active, with the ACTIVE RECOVERY module: increase your daily METs! A set of physical movements and quick body exercises to energize you and to give your brain a boost! Everything tailored to your fitness level and to your actual needs (remember the feedback loop!)  - We need to recover, to be better next time. Here comes the RENEWAL PERIOD module: just sit and relax for a reinvigorating session, keeping your energy levels balanced during your day!
